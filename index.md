# Introduction

This is the demo page of the expiriments in [Noise Adaptive Speech Enhancement using Domain Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07501).

In the paper we trained a set of models to adapt to the BabyCry noise, here we also show another set of models that are adapted to the cafeteria noise.
